# EYE-TRACKER (using openCV)


`eyetracker.ipynb` is a Python script designed to utilize computer vision techniques, often with libraries like OpenCV and dlib, to detect and track human eyes in real-time 
video streams or recorded videos. This script can identify and locate eyes within frames, enabling applications such as gaze estimation, blink detection, or eye-controlled
interfaces for accessibility and interaction purposes.
